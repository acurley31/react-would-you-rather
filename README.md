# React Would You Rather
This is a React application to allow users to ask and answer "Would you rather?" style questions. Users can select one of the pre-created users during login and ask/answer questions on their behalf. A leaderboard lists the top users by ranked by their cumulative contributions (asked/answered question totals).


## Installation
1. To get started with this app, clone the repository:

  `git clone https://github.com/acurley31/react-would-you-rather.git`

2. Navigate into the project directory and install all dependencies (i.e. react, react-router-dom, redux, etc.)
  
  `cd react-would-you-rather`

3. Once all the dependencies have been installed properly, start the development server:

  `npm start` or `yarn start`
