# React Would You Rather
This is a React application to allow users to ask and answer "Would you rather?" style questions. Users can select one of the pre-created users during login and ask/answer questions on their behalf. A leaderboard lists the top users by ranked by their cumulative contributions (asked/answered question totals).
